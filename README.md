# ethash-ecip1043
Ethash reference implementation, adapted for ECIP-1043
======================================================

This repository contains
* a runnable version of
  [ethash.py](https://eth.wiki/en/concepts/ethash/ethash)
  that produces the same results as real-life Ethash
* an adaptation (ethash_ecip1043.py) that implements the DAG size limiting
  mechanism proposed in
  [ECIP-1043](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1043)
* a dummy pool server that implements part of the
  [Ethereum JSON-RPC API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API)
  and that can be used for testing miner implementations

The Web server is still work in progress and doesn't properly support
ECIP-1043 yet.


ethash.py
---------

ethash.py is a slightly cleaned up version of the Ethash reference
implementation. It has been tested with data obtained from real-life
ETH/ETC mining.

ethash.py can be used as a library or it can be invoked as a program.
In the latter case, it accepts the following three arguments:
* the decimal epoch number
* the hexadecimal header hash, as a very long integer beginning with 0x
* the hexadecimal nonce, also beginning with 0x

It then computes:
* the seedhash for the requested epoch
* the **compressed** mix, obtained by hashing header plus nonce
* the **result**, obtained from the same operation.

The result is the value that is then used for comparison with the
difficulty target.

Example run:
```
./ethash.py 359 0x667c94657d5b6922693e2e6ac77b80861b80ff949c795ef4b18551e8c389a2f1 0x710a38013066d8ce

```


ethash_ecip1043.py
------------------

Like ethash.py, but has two additional variables:
* `ecip1043_activation_epoch` defines at epoch at which the DAG size
  is frozen, as defined in ECIP-1043
* `ecip1043_fixed_epoch` is the epoch to whose size the DAG size is set

If invoking ethash_ecip1043.py as a program, these variables can be set
with the command-line option
`--ecip1043`=_activation_epoch_`,`_fixed_epoch_

Example run:
```
./ethash_ecip1043.py --ecip1043=350,64 359 0x667c94657d5b6922693e2e6ac77b80861b80ff949c795ef4b18551e8c389a2f1 0x710a38013066d8ce

```


pool.py
-------

pool.py is a very simple pool server that speaks (only) the stratum protocol
that uses eth_getWork.

The pool server allows miners to connect and register, generated mining
jobs for them, and verifies their submissions using ethash_ecip1043.py

### Commands

The following commands can be entered on the pool server's console
(standard input):
* `diff` _bits_   
  The pool difficulty in bits. Defaults to 24 bits.
* `ecip1043` [_activation_*,*_fixed_]   
  Sets the activation and fixed epoch for ECIP-1043. The arguments must be
  decimal numbers. If no arguments are given, an impossibly high activation
  epoch is set, disabling ECIP-1043 mode.
* `epoch` _epoch_   
  The decimal number of the epoch the pool will ask miners to mine in
  (the miners are not told the exact block number).
* `help`   
  In case you get lost.
* `job`   
  Sends a new mining job to all the connected miners that have previously
  sent an eth_getWork request.
* `start` _port_   
  Start the pool server on the specified TCP port. The port is a decimal
  number.
* `submit` _hdr_ _nonce_   
  Submit a mining result, consisting of header and nonce. Both are hexadecimal
  numbers beginning with 0x.

The console is left by sending an EOF.

### Command-line options and arguments

The following options are accepted:

* `-d=`_bits_ or `--difficulty=`_bits_   
  Set the difficulty, like with the `diff` command.
* `-c` or `--cache`   
  Enables caching of the cache data. Since computation of the cache is rather
  slow in Python, the cache can optionally be stored in a file. This file is
  named _epoch_`.cache` (Note: for ECIP-1043 support, we will also need to add
  the frozen epoch number.)
* `-e=`_epoch_ or `--epoch=`_epoch_   
  Set up the indicated epoch before starting to accept commands or connections.
* `--ecip1043=`_activation_`,`_fixed_   
  The ECIP-1043 epochs, like in ethash_ecip1043.py
* `-v` or `--verbose`   
  Be a bit more chatty.

There is one optional argument:

* _port_   
  The decimal number of the TCP port on which the pool server listens.
  This starts the pool server before accepting commands, i.e., this
  replaces the `start` command.

### Development status

Very lightly tested. ECIP-1043 mode of the pool server has not been tried yet.


### Example invocation

```
./pool.py -e 360 -v -c 9999
```

This initializes the pool server for epoch 360, writes the *cache* to
the file `360.cache` (cache generation can take several minutes), then
runs the pool server on TCP port 9999 with verbose reporting enabled.
